          <h4>I could just get my friend to check on me right?</h4>
          <p>I guess we've all tried that, and it doesn't really work. The problem with friends is that they like you, and will give you little or no hassle when you show up with a story about how the dog ate your homework. If you beg and plead enough, they let you off the hook. They feel uncomfortable calling you out on your bullshit, and pushing you or reminding you beyond one or two times. Plus, they have jobs and school and families and pets and grocery shopping to do, and cannot really spend much effort or time chasing you up.</p>

          <p>Yes, and we've probably used all of them! Todo list apps and habit trackers are great, but what happens when you inevitably stop using them in a week when the novelty wears off? What happens when you don't do what you're supposed to do? The problem is that these apps provide no accountability, which may be cool for some people, but not for those of us who need the extra push. You don't need another app to list your todos. You need something to make sure you follow through.</p>

          <p>Boss as a Service is certainly not for everybody. Some people work well without someone standing over them. Some of us, though, need the kick in the pants. If any of the following scenarios is familiar to you and has you nodding and saying "Yup, that's just me", maybe you want to consider it.</p>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <li>You're a chronic procastinator, but you work well when there's an impending deadline. Pulling all-nighters before an exam or an important deadline is something you'd do.</li>
            <li>You've noticed that you are more productive when you have a boss or a supervisor to report to, but as a freelancer, founder or student, you do a lot of independent work.</li>
            <li>You struggle with unstructured time, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's Law</a> is your grim reality.</li>

          <p>Okay, maybe it is, a little bit. But it's only because we know we'd totally try to cheat.</p>
          <p>You know sometimes, you'll say you've gone for a run, when the truth is you've been lounging in your pajamas all day and eating Doritos. Maybe you <i>plan</i> to go for a run later that night, so you think it's okay to just say you already have. So yeah, we wouldn't be doing you any favours if we're flexible about this. We'll only count the things you're able to prove as actually done. In other words, pics or it didn't happen.</p>
          <p>So what does proof look like?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go for 3km run -- you could send us a screenshot from Runkeeper</li>
            <li>Code for 1 hour -- you could send us a screenshot of your Rescuetime stats</li>
            <li>Fix form dropdown bug -- maybe a gif of the form dropdown now working?</li>
          </ul>
          You can blur out senstive data, just make sure your computer / phone time and date is present.

You signed up to be more productive, not to falsify evidence! Besides, there's surely a point where just doing whatever it is is easier than making up fake proof.

            <li>People value what they pay for. If you didn't pay, you could easily block our emails -- you don't lose anything, which results in zero value addition to anybody.</li>

We got the idea from those annoying pop ups that have the passive aggressive copy like "Yes, please send me my 48 page ebook on growing pot-plants" as opposed to "No, I am very happy being a pot-plantless loser."</p>
