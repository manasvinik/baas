          <h3>Is this for me?</h3>
          <p>Boss as a Service is certainly not for everybody. Some people work well without someone standing over them. Some of us, though, need the kick in the pants. If any of the following scenarios is familiar to you and has you nodding and saying "Yup, that's me", maybe you want to consider it.</p>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <li>You're a chronic procrastinator, but you work well when there's an impending deadline. Pulling all-nighters before an exam or an important deadline is something you'd do.</li>
            <li>You've noticed that you are more productive when you have a team or a supervisor to report to, but as a freelancer, founder or student, you do a lot of independent work.</li>
            <li>You struggle with unstructured time, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's Law</a> is your grim reality.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Boss as a Service is not for you if you're not looking to seriously accelerate your productivity.</span> If you're not committed to this, you'll probably just find our follow ups and questions annoying. We force you to confront your bad work habits and defaulting. That can be a bit unpleasant at times -- nobody likes being reminded that they skipped gym for the last 2 weeks -- but it's necessary we do so! If that's not what you want from us, you won't like this.</p>

          <h3>I could just get my friend to check on me right?</h3>
          <p>We've all tried that, and it doesn't really work. The problem with friends is that they like you, and will give you little or no hassle when you show up with a story about how the dog ate your homework. If you beg and plead enough, they let you off the hook. They feel uncomfortable calling you out on your bullshit. Polite, occassional reminders don't work. Plus, they have jobs and families and grocery shopping and Tinder swiping to do, and cannot really spend much effort or time chasing you up. </p>

          <p>Hey, it's not like that, babe, we swear.</p>
          <p>Okay, maybe it is, a little bit. But it's only because we're habitual procrastinators ourselves, and know that in your place, we'd totally try to cheat.</p>
          <p>Maybe you've been lounging around in your pajamas all day eating Doritos, but you <i>plan</i> to go for a run later that night. So you think it's okay to tell us that you already have. We know how that's going to turn out -- in a guilt-filled unholy orgy of Dorito excesses. So we wouldn't be doing you any favours if we're flexible about the "Prove it" rule. We'll only count the tasks you're able to prove as tasks actually done. In other words, pics or it didn't happen.</p>
          <p>So what does proof look like?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go for 3km run -- you could send us a screenshot from <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a></li>
            <li>Code for 1 hour -- you could send us a screenshot of your <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">Rescuetime stats</a></li>
            <li>Fix form dropdown bug -- maybe a gif of the form dropdown now working?</li>
          </ul>
          You can blur out sensitive data, just make sure your computer / phone time and date is present.

            <li>The reason Boss as a Service works is because we have pleasant but hard nosed, living, breathing humans who check your proof to make sure your work is really done, chase you down and keep you on track.</li>
            <li>People value what they pay for. If you didn't pay, you could easily block our messages or ignore us -- you don't lose anything. Which results in zero value addition to anybody.</li>
            <li>If we didn't charge money we couldn't sustain this in the long run. One day, you will wake up to find us gone, and you'd have lost the only tool that ever helped you get anything done, and you'd be very sad.</li>

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Every email I've gotten has been encouraging and positive, and <span class="boldquote">it honestly helps keep me accountable</span>.</p>

<!-- Card 2 -->
<div class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Boss as a Service has been <span class="boldquote">fundamental in launching my business</span>. Every task from company formation to building our prototype was, originally, something accomplished through BaaS.</p>

<!-- Card 4 -->
<div class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text"><span class="boldquote">Legitimately life changing</span>. I'm sure it's not for everyone ... but rather than procrastinate and say "oh I'll just finish this tomorrow" I know I'm going to have to come up with an excuse for "my boss". That excuse is often more work than just doing the task so the end result is I get more done. Been using it for about a month and it's probably been <span class="boldquote">one of the most productive months of my entire life</span>.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">I cannot say how effective this has been over just the last few days. <span class="boldquote">TLDR: I'm infinitely grateful this service exists.

Plainly and simply you have my heartfelt thanks, I'm just happy I was browsing Product Hunt when I was because from simply 6 days ago the difference in how I've been utilizing my task manager, calendar and other resources has been night and day.</span>  It's gotten my butt in gear and I hope it'll help me keep it in gear for a long time to come.</p>

<p class="card-text">I have to admit, I was hesitating, do I really need this? And it turns out I do! BaaS has been working great for me so far, <span class="boldquote">it gave me the extra push to achieve what I have planned each day</span>, which I believe will make a HUGE difference in the long run.</p>
